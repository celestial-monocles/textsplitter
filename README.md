# Text Splitter

## Features

- Paste text directly into the input area.
- Specify the number of splits.
- Automatically divides text into equal sections (handling uneven splits gracefully).
- Displays each split in a read-only text box.
- Includes a **Copy Text** button for each text box to copy content to the clipboard easily.
- No external dependenciesâ€”works in any modern browser.

2. **Enter Splits**: Specify the number of splits (e.g., 3).
3. **Click Split**: Press the "Split Text" button to generate the split outputs.
4. **Copy Outputs**: Use the "Copy Text" button below each output box to copy its contents to the clipboard.
